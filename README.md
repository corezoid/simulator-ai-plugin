# Simulator.Company — Claude Code & Codex Plugin

> **Status:** stable — released, actively maintained. Supported clients: Claude Code ≥ 1.x, Codex. Go 1.24+ required. macOS and Linux tested.

A plugin for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and [Codex](https://codex.openai.com) that connects the [Simulator.Company](https://simulator.company) platform to Claude via MCP (Model Context Protocol). Claude gets direct access to the Simulator REST API and domain knowledge to manage actors, graphs, forms, and financial accounts through natural conversation.

## What it does

The plugin bundles a Go MCP server that exposes the full Simulator.Company public API as MCP tools and provides specialist skills that teach Claude the platform's entity model and common workflows:

| Skill                | Activate with                                            | Covers                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `simulator`          | "use Simulator", "call Simulator API"                    | Full platform overview, all entities, MCP tools         |
| `simulator-init`     | "setup", "connect to simulator", "login to simulator"    | OAuth login, workspace selection, environment setup     |
| `simulator-graph`    | "create actor", "link nodes", "add to layer"             | Actors, links, layers, graph traversal, bulk push/pull  |
| `simulator-forms`    | "create form", "design template", "field structure"      | Form templates, field types, system forms               |
| `simulator-finance`  | "record transaction", "account balance", "transfer funds"| Accounts, transactions, transfers, currencies           |

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) or [Codex](https://codex.openai.com) installed
- [Go 1.24+](https://go.dev/dl/) available in `PATH` (the MCP server runs via `go run`, no build step needed)
  ```bash
  brew install golang        # macOS
  sudo apt install golang    # Ubuntu/Debian
  ```
  Verify with `go version`.
- A Simulator.Company account

## Installation

### Claude Code

**From the GitHub marketplace:**

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add corezoid/simulator-ai-plugin
claude plugin install simulator@simulator
```

**Or from a local clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/corezoid/simulator-ai-plugin
claude plugin marketplace add ./simulator-ai-plugin
claude plugin install simulator@simulator
```

### Codex

**From the GitHub marketplace:**

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add corezoid/simulator-ai-plugin
codex plugin install simulator@simulator
```

**Or from a local clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/corezoid/simulator-ai-plugin
codex plugin marketplace add ./simulator-ai-plugin
codex plugin install simulator@simulator
```

No build step, no extra setup. The MCP server starts automatically on first use.

### Updating

```bash
claude plugin update simulator@simulator   # Claude Code
codex plugin update simulator@simulator    # Codex
```

Restart Claude Code / Codex after updating to apply the new version.

## Authentication

On the first Simulator operation Claude detects that no token is present and runs the `login` tool automatically — your browser opens at `account.corezoid.com` for OAuth2 sign-in and the session continues without interruption. After login Claude uses MCP elicitation to let you pick a workspace from the list returned by the account API.

The token is saved to `.env` in your working directory (mode `0600`) and reused on every subsequent session. When it expires, the login flow triggers again automatically.

You can also trigger login manually at any time:

```
log in to Simulator
```

### Static token (optional)

If you prefer to manage the token yourself, set it in `.env` or export it before starting Claude Code or Codex:

```bash
export ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

The static token takes priority over saved credentials.

## Configuration

| Environment variable          | Required | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCESS_TOKEN`                | No       | Static token — overrides OAuth2 saved credentials                           |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT`     | No       | Token expiry timestamp (RFC 3339) — written automatically after OAuth login |
| `ACCOUNT_URL`                 | No       | Override the default account URL (`https://account.corezoid.com`)           |
| `WORKSPACE_ID`                | No       | Default workspace ID (`accId`) — set automatically after `set-workspace`    |
| `SIMULATOR_PROFILE`           | No       | Environment profile: `local` \| `prod` (default `prod`); also via `--profile` |
| `SIMULATOR_API_BASE_URL`      | No       | Override the profile's API base URL (e.g. `http://localhost:9000/papi/1.0`)  |
| `SIMULATOR_ACCOUNT_URL`       | No       | Override the profile's OAuth account (SA) URL                                |
| `SIMULATOR_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`   | No       | OAuth2 client ID — on-prem deployments with a custom authorization server should set this to their own client ID; cloud (account.corezoid.com) users do not need it |

All values are read from a `.env` file in the current working directory at startup, and the `login` / `set-workspace` tools persist their results back to that file.

## Usage

Once installed, just talk to Claude naturally:

```
Create a business process graph for customer onboarding with three steps:
Document Collection → Review → Approval. Add all steps to a layer.
```

```
Create a Car form template with fields: make, model, year, color, VIN.
Add financial accounts: purchase value (USD asset), maintenance costs (USD expense),
and a mileage counter (km).
```

```
Record a $450 maintenance transaction on the Toyota Camry actor.
Then show me all accounts and their current balances.
```

```
Search for all actors of form type "Task" on the "Main Process" layer.
```

```
Pull layer 1a2b3c4d-... to a local YAML, let me edit it, then push it back.
```

## MCP Tools

The MCP server exposes a **curated, typed tool set (~46 tools)** scoped to the core
scenarios — forms, actors, accounts, transactions, graph building, applications/smart forms
— rather than the entire REST surface. Each tool maps to a backend operation by its
`operationId`; a drift gate keeps the set in sync with the live `/papi/1.0` contract.

**Curated API operations** (one tool per backend operation):

| Domain        | Tools                                                                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Forms         | `createForm` `getForm` `getForms` `searchForms` `updateForm` `deleteForm` `setFormStatus` |
| Actors        | `createActor` `getActor` `getActorByRef` `searchActors` `searchLayerActors` `updateActor` `deleteActor` `setActorStatus` |
| Accounts      | `createAccount` `getAccounts` `getBalance` `updateAccount` `deleteAccount` `createCurrency` `getCurrencies` `createAccountName` `getAccountNames` |
| Transactions  | `createTransaction` `finalizeTransaction` `getTransactions` `createTransfer` `getTransfer` |
| Graph         | `createLink` `massLink` `getEdgeTypes` `getLayerActors` `manageLayerActors`            |
| Applications  | `createApplication` `createSmartForm` `listSmartForms` `manageAppContent`              |
| Auth          | `login` `set-workspace`                                                                |

**Engine tools** (multi-call workflows + client-side computation):

| Tool                     | Description                                                                                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pullGraphFile`          | Fetch all actors and edges from a layer and write them to `<layerId>.yaml` in the working directory  |
| `pushGraphFile`          | Read `<layerId>.yaml` and sync it with the server layer: create / update / remove to match the file  |
| `getAllLayerPlacements`  | Return every actor placement on a layer in one paginated call                                        |
| `compactGraphLayout`     | Auto-layout a layer into domain-clustered grids (replaces the pull → edit → push loop)               |
| `pruneLongEdges`         | Delete edges longer than a distance threshold; preserves hierarchy edges                             |
| `uploadActorPicture` / `uploadActorPictureBulk` | Set actor pictures from URL / file / base64; auto-rasterise SVG → PNG; bulk dedupes by SHA-256 |
| `createChart`            | Create a dashboard chart actor (dynamic `actorFilter` or explicit accounts mode)                     |

```

The server exposes a curated, typed tool set declared in Go (not a generic spec passthrough);
a drift gate validates those declarations against the backend's `papi-openapi.json`. Skills
add the domain knowledge on top. For the full design — profiles, the tool registry, engines,
the drift gate, and the auth flow — see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Debugging

Run the server directly against a profile and enable verbose logging with `SIMULATOR_DEBUG`:

```bash
cd plugins/simulator/mcp-server
SIMULATOR_DEBUG=1 go run ./cmd/server --profile local
```

Tests cover config, the HTTP client, the curated tools (scenarios + `-race`), the backend
drift gate, and the eval scenarios:

```bash
go test ./...
```
