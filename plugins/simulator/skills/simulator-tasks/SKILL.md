  Simulator.Company task & assignment specialist — creating a task and assigning who
  does it, who approves it, and whose signature it needs. In Simulator a task is an
  actor of the Events system form (no chatType), and the roles are access privileges,
  not data fields: the executor gets `execute`, approvers get `sign`, and a legal
  document's signers get `ds`. Completion and sign-off are then posted as `done` /
  `sign` / `reject` reactions. Use when the user wants to "create a task", "assign a
  task to", "set an executor/assignee", "add approvers", "require a signature", "who
  signs this", "make a to-do". Also covers **order / directive documents** that tell a
  specific person to do something — an "order/наказ addressed to X" is a task whose
  addressee is the executor. Activate on "create a task", "assign to", "task for",

# Simulator.Company Task Specialist

In Simulator.Company a **task is an actor of the `Events` system form** with **no
`chatType`** (an empty/absent `chatType` is what separates a task / plain event from a
chat). The Events form is the same one used for calendar events, SIP meetings, and chats
— `chatType` is what disambiguates them.

> **Orders / directives are tasks.** A request to create an **order / directive document**
> aimed at a person — «створи наказ **на** Салімова про …», «склади розпорядження для …»,
> "create an order for X to …", ru «приказ на …» — is a task, not a plain event. The
> **addressee** ("на <кого>" / "for <whom>") is the **executor**: create the Events actor,
> then **grant that person `execute`** via `saveAccessRules` (step 4 below). Putting the
> name only in the title/description is the common mistake — without the `execute` rule the
> person is not assigned and gets no `done` action. Resolve the addressee's `userId` with
> `searchUsers` first; if other people are named to approve/sign, give them `sign`/`ds`.
>
> **If the workspace has a dedicated «наказ»/order form (with example documents), mirror an
> example — don't just `createActor` and stop.** Read one existing order of that form
> (`getActor` + `getAccessRules`) and reproduce **how it assigns the responsible person**:
> typically an `execute` **access rule** for the addressee (`saveAccessRules`), and/or a
> responsible/executor **data field** on the form (a `workspaceMembers` dynamic-select whose
> value is the user id — see the actor `data` protocol). Set whichever the example uses, and
> **always grant the addressee access** — an order with no access rule for the person never
> appears in their events. Creating the actor alone is not "assigned".

A task's **roles are access privileges on the task actor**, not data fields:

| Role | Privilege | How they act on the task |
|---|---|---|
| **Executor / assignee** (виконавець) | `execute` | Marks the work complete with a **`done`** reaction |
| **Approver** (хто погоджує) | `sign` | Approves with a **`sign`** reaction, or declines with **`reject`** |
| **Legal-document signer** (підпис на юр. документі) | `ds` | Applies a qualified digital signature with a **`ds`** reaction |
| **Watcher** | `view` only | Can see the task; no action |

> `view` is implied when any other privilege is set. One person can hold several roles
> (e.g. `{execute:true, sign:true}`) — that's one rule with both flags. Different people
> get separate rules.

There is **no server-side "a task must have an executor / must be approved in order"
enforcement** — a task is composed from `createActor` + `saveAccessRules` + reactions,
and **this skill owns that discipline**.

## Test case: "create a task, assign it, and require a signature"

### 1 — Resolve the Events form id (per workspace)

```
getForms(formTypes="system")    # find the row whose title == "Events" → its id
```

The Events form id differs per workspace — don't hardcode it. (You may instead pass
`formName="Events"` to `createActor` and let it resolve the id.)

### 2 — Resolve the people (executor, approvers, signers)

Every grantee is a real workspace `userId` — resolve it, never guess:

```
searchUsers(query="<name>")     # → that person's userId (e.g. 4210)
getUsers()                      # browse all members if you need to pick
```

Collect: the **executor's** userId, each **approver's** userId, and (for a legal
document) each **DS signer's** userId.

### 3 — Create the task (an Events actor, no chatType)

```
createActor(
  formName="Events",                       # or formId=<EventsFormId>
  title="<task name>",                     # short label, e.g. "Prepare Q3 supplier contract"
  description="<the task body / instructions>",   # the full text of the task goes HERE
  data={ "startDate": <nowUnixSeconds>,    # required by the Events form
         "endDate":   <deadlineUnixSeconds> })   # the due date
```

- **The task body goes in the actor's `description`.** `title` is the short label; the
  full instructions / brief of the task are the actor's **`description`** field (the
  `description` argument of `createActor`) — not a comment reaction and not `data`.
- `startDate` / `endDate` are **required** by the Events form and are **plain unix
  seconds** on Events (not the nested calendar object the generic `data` protocol uses).
  Use `startDate` = now (or the scheduled start) and `endDate` = the **deadline**.
- **Do not set `chatType`** — a task is not a chat. Setting it would turn the actor into
  a chat (see `simulator-chat`).

### 4 — Assign the roles (one `saveAccessRules` call)

Grant each person their role on the task actor. `execute` = does it, `sign` = approves
it, `ds` = legally signs it. `view`/`modify`/`remove` are required booleans; the
role flags are optional.

```
saveAccessRules(objType="actor", objId="<taskId>", rules=[
  # Executor — can act on and complete the task:
  { "action":"create", "data":{ "userId": <executorId>,
      "privs":{ "view":true, "modify":true, "remove":false, "execute":true } } },

  # Approver(s) — must sign off. reactionOrders.sign sets the order (1 = first):
  { "action":"create", "data":{ "userId": <approver1Id>,
      "privs":{ "view":true, "modify":false, "remove":false, "sign":true },
      "reactionOrders":{ "sign": 1 } } },
  { "action":"create", "data":{ "userId": <approver2Id>,
      "privs":{ "view":true, "modify":false, "remove":false, "sign":true },
      "reactionOrders":{ "sign": 2 } } }
])
```

For a **legal document** that needs a qualified e-signature, grant `ds` instead of (or
in addition to) `sign`, and order signers with `reactionOrders.ds`:

```
saveAccessRules(objType="actor", objId="<taskId>", rules=[
  { "action":"create", "data":{ "userId": <signerId>,
      "privs":{ "view":true, "modify":false, "remove":false, "ds":true },
      "reactionOrders":{ "ds": 1 } } }
])
```

> `saveAccessRules` is applied **asynchronously** and returns a **`taskId`** (the async
> job id — unrelated to the task actor). Grants take a moment to propagate; that's fine.
> The creator is the **owner implicitly** — do not add a self access-rule.

### 5 — (Optional) Add follow-up notes / kick off

The task body itself is the actor's `description` (step 3). Use a **`comment` reaction**
only for *additional* discussion or to ping someone — not for the task body:

```
createReaction(type="comment", actorId="<taskId>", description="<a follow-up note>")
```

To notify the executor through the platform AI agent (acts under the requesting user's
access), add `extra={mcp:true}` — see `simulator-reactions`.

### 6 — Lifecycle (how the task is completed & approved)

These reactions are posted **by the assigned users** (your job is to set the task up so
they can):

- **Executor** finishes → `createReaction(type="done", actorId="<taskId>")`.
- **Approver** signs off → `createReaction(type="sign", actorId="<taskId>")`, or declines
  → `createReaction(type="reject", actorId="<taskId>", description="<reason>")`.
- **DS signer** applies the qualified signature → `createReaction(type="ds", actorId="<taskId>")`.
- Read progress: `getReactions(actorId="<taskId>", view="flat")` — count `done` / `sign` /
  `ds` / `reject` against the people you assigned.

> The reaction text (a comment body, a rejection reason) always goes in the
> **`description`** argument of `createReaction` — there is no `content` argument.

---

## Variations

- **One person is both executor and approver.** Combine flags in a single rule:
  `privs:{ view:true, execute:true, sign:true }`.
- **Reorder / change approvers.** `action:"update"` with a new `reactionOrders`, or
  `action:"delete"` (grantee id only) to remove someone.
- **Assign to a group.** Use `groupId` instead of `userId` in the rule (resolve it with
  `getUser(type="group")`).
- **Many tasks at once.** Create each Events actor, then `bulkSaveAccessRules` (≤50
  objects) to assign roles across all of them in one call.
- **Find a person's tasks.** `filterActors(formId=<EventsFormId>, q="chatType=",
  members="<userId>:execute")` — Events actors with an empty chatType where that user
  has the execute role. (Use `q="chatType="` to exclude chats.)

## Safety & correctness rules

- **No `chatType` on a task.** An Events actor with a `chatType` is a chat, not a task —
  leave it empty/absent.
- **Roles are access rules, never `data` fields.** Don't store executor/approver ids in
  `data`; grant `execute` / `sign` / `ds` via `saveAccessRules`.
- **Resolve every `userId` first** (`searchUsers` / `getUsers`) — grantees must belong to
  the workspace or the rule is rejected. Don't guess ids.
- **Confirm before assigning on someone's behalf** if it notifies them — `saveAccessRules`
  (default `notify=true`) and reactions notify the people involved. Use `notify=false`
  to stay quiet.
- **`execute` vs `sign` vs `ds`.** `execute` = the doer; `sign` = an approval/sign-off;
  `ds` = a legally-binding digital signature (use for юридичні документи). Pick by intent.
- `startDate`/`endDate` are **required** and are plain unix **seconds** on Events.

## Relationship to the other skills

| Skill | Boundary |
|---|---|
| `simulator-chat` | The *chat* use of the Events form (`chatType` set); a task has **no** chatType. |
| `simulator-access` | Access rules in general — the `execute`/`sign`/`ds`/`reactionOrders` model lives there. |
| `simulator-reactions` | The `done`/`sign`/`reject` reaction mechanics used to complete and approve a task. |
| `simulator-actors` | The Events actor's own `data` fields and the actor `data` value protocol. |
| `simulator-init` | Login + workspace selection (needed before any of this). |

## Reference Documents

| Path | When to read |
|---|---|
| `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/docs/entities/tasks.md` | The task model: Events actor + execute/sign/ds roles + done/sign/reject lifecycle |
| `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/docs/entities/chats.md` | The shared Events-form field list (startDate/endDate as unix seconds) |
| `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/docs/entities/reactions.md` | Reaction types (`done`, `sign`, `reject`), threading, AI-agent reactions |

## Tips

- `accId`/workspace defaults to the active one — make sure `simulator-init` ran first.
- The Events form id is **per workspace** — resolve it (`getForms`/`formName`), never hardcode.
- A task = `createActor(formName="Events", description="<body>", data={startDate,endDate})` **without** `chatType`.
- **The task body is the actor's `description`** (`title` = short label); comments are for follow-up only.
- Roles = one `saveAccessRules` call: `execute` (doer), `sign` (approver), `ds` (legal signature).
- Order sequential approvals with `reactionOrders.sign` / `.ds` (positive ints, 1 = first).
- Completion/approval are `done` / `sign` / `reject` reactions posted by the assignees.
